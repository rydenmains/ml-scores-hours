📊 **Student Score Prediction with Machine Learning Regression**

🚀 **Overview**  
This project leverages machine learning regression to predict student performance using a publicly available dataset. The focus is on using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍 and feature engineering ⚙️ to prepare the data, then implementing and comparing two regression models to determine the best predictor of student scores.

🏫 **Background Problem**  
In today’s data-centric education landscape, accurately forecasting student performance is essential. By analyzing factors such as study hours ⏱️ and exam scores 🎯, educators and policymakers can gain valuable insights to improve academic support and optimize resource allocation.

🛠 **Steps in This Project**

1️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Data Insight:** Understand the dataset by exploring its structure and statistical properties 📈.
   - **Visualization:** Create visual representations to illustrate data distributions and trends 📊.
   - **Correlation Analysis:** Identify relationships between key features 🔗.

2️⃣ **Feature Engineering**
   - **Data Cleaning:** Remove duplicate entries and handle any missing values 🧹.
   - **Outlier Analysis:** Detect and address anomalies in the data 🚩.

3️⃣ **Regression Modeling**
   - **Model Implementation:** Develop two regression models:
     - Linear Regression ➕
     - Decision Tree Regressor 🌳
   - **Comparison:** Evaluate and compare the performance of each model 🏆.

4️⃣ **Model Evaluation**
   - **Performance Metrics:** Use the R-squared (R²) score to assess model accuracy and reliability 📏.

5️⃣ **Conclusion**
   - **Outcome:** Determine which regression model most effectively predicts student scores 🎓.

💻 **Technologies and Tools**  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn
