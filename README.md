# Student Scores - Machine Learning Regression Project

📌 **Project Overview**  
This project aims to analyze the Student Scores dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), apply Feature Engineering, and build Machine Learning Regression Models to predict student scores based on various factors. The goal is to determine which model performs best in predicting student performance.

🏫 Background Problem

In today’s data-driven education landscape, understanding and predicting student performance is crucial for educators, institutions, and policymakers. With the increasing availability of educational data, such as study habits and exam outcomes, there is a significant opportunity to derive actionable insights that can enhance academic support and resource allocation.

🚀 **Steps in This Project**  
1️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Understanding the dataset  
- Visualizing data distributions  
- Identifying correlations between features  

2️⃣ **Feature Engineering**
- Checking for duplicated data  
- Handling missing values  
- Performing outlier analysis  

3️⃣ **Machine Learning Regression Modeling**
- We implement and compare two regression models:
  - Linear Regression  
  - Decision Tree Regressor  

4️⃣ **Model Evaluation**
- We evaluate model performance using key regression metrics:
  - R-squared Score (R²)  

5️⃣ **Conclusion**
- After model evaluation, we determine which model provides the best performance for predicting student scores.

🔧 **Technologies Used**  
Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn)  
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab for analysis and modeling

📂 **Dataset**  
The dataset used in this project is publicly available and contains information about students' study hours and their corresponding scores.
